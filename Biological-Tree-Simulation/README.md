# Biological-Tree-Simulation

Simulation Model of a biological tree in Netlogo

## WHAT IS IT

It's a general representation of biological tree.

## HOW IT WORKS

1) Creating the patches
 a) Patches for sky
 b) Patches for ground
 c) Patches for sun

2) Creating base structure of the biological tree
 a) Making stem part
 b) Making root part

3) Hatching
 a) Seperately hatching root part
 b) Seperately hatching part above the ground

Hatching:- Hatching of turtles for both the patches seperately by certain angle in both left and right direction that too with certain color.

Variable quantities are angle, rootLength, steemLength, stemWidth.

Every new instance a) angle increases b) length parameter decreases by certain value. 

## HOW TO USE IT

Stem Angle slider - This slider used to choose the angle of stem with which tree should grow.

clear button - This button vanishes off the whole screen and create the new patches as a background view for the biological tree.

go button - This button does the actual implementation work which is mentioned above in HOW IT WORKS tab. 

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Creation of base structure of tree including stem and root part is different from its further growing process.

Individual hatching of turtles present above & below the ground.

Difference between shape and color of both types of hatching.
 
## THINGS TO TRY

Change in direction of growth of tree as per change in the stem angle set by slider.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

We can show:
Variation in the growth of tree depending upon the presence of sunlight and water.

Direction of tree growth varies depending upon direction of sun. Growth of roots in the direction of water available.

Life of tree over change of environment and how it affects the tree by any means like color change of leaves and etc.

Fruits and Flowers
